# Laboratory-Activity-No.-04-FERRER

Lab Activity No. 04 involves using CSS to improve a webpage. Here are the instructions:

Create an HTML page with a header, body section, text, at least one image, and a table with any number of rows and columns.
Create an external CSS file and link it properly to the webpage. The CSS file should contain at least 5 different classes or IDs that modify elements of the linked webpage.
Use at least one class or ID to control the layout using layers (Div tag), and the others to modify fonts, colors, and background-color. If you want an extra challenge, explore other CSS properties for webpage design on W3schools.
To set up, download everything and the website will work as intended.
